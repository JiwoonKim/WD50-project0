# Project 0

For CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Created a web page to practice using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass
The website page is about introducing myself in terms of who I am, what challenges I have done or are in the process, where I have traveled, and finally my portfolio.
A total of 4 html files (pages) can be navigated from the top navigation bar.
about.html is default with a short introduction of myself.
portfolio.html is the projects I have done in the past.
challenges.html contains the challenges (habits, projects, etc.) in the process along with completed challenges and future challenges in mind.
traveled.html contains a travel log of all the places I have been in the world via a map with markers and a table for short descriptions.
